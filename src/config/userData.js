  myDescription: [
    `I’m a Software Engineer Intern at Evolko where I'm leading the
    frontend engineering team of one of the company's prime products
    which focuses on an enhanced virtual collaboration between doctors
    and patients in order to promote social distancing in the post
    COVID-19 world. Along with that, I'm a Graduate Software
    Engineering Student as well as a Graduate Research Assistant at
    San Jose State University. Before starting my masters, I was a full time Software Development
    Engineer at Deloitte while during my undergrad, I was the Vice Convenor of a technical club
    in addition to being an Undergraduate Researcher for 1.5 years. In
    that run, I completed an IEEE award winning personal research project which in turn was published by Springer.`,
    `My recent work reflects my already piqued interest in web development and so I love (LOVE!) participating in hackathons. I successfully completed the
    Opportunity Hack 2019 organized by PayPal at their HQ and was
    selected by Facebook to participate in the FB San Francisco
    Hackathon in Nov 2019, and successfully completed that too. Outside of work, I'm obsessed with streak coding, writing English poems and reading History. Feel free to reach out to me, I love chit-chatting on random topics :D`,
